# Clinical study analysis

### <ins>Goal of the project:</ins>
To generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of a clinical study conducted by a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications and to create a top-level summary of the study results.
### <ins>Study:</ins>
249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

### <ins>Technology:</ins> 
Pandas and Matplotlib

### <ins>Analysis:</ins>
- There is only 1 outlier in the total dataset and not a single outlier for the Camopulin treatment. which makes the results statistically significant.
- The biggest number of mice were tested for the Capomulin and Ramicane drug treatments. Moreover, these drug regimens had the lowest standard deviation(4.994774 and 4.846308 respectively). Further analysis of these drug regimens is likely to produce reliable results.
- There is a fairly positive linear correlation of 0.84 between the weight of mice and average tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen.
- The analysis of tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin showed a steady increase from timepoint 0 to 20 followed by a decrease almost all the way to its lowest value between timepoints 30 and 40.
- The distribution between male versus female mice is close to equal: 51.0% and 49.0% respectively.
